# Project Description

- In this project, I will analyze tabular data pertaining to startups that operated from 1980 to 2018, with the objective of predicting which startups are likely to continue their operations and which may close.

- The primary goal is to develop a robust machine learning model capable of assessing startup viability. Additionally, I conduct a comprehensive exploratory analysis to uncover valuable insights and formulate recommendations for future founders regarding the key factors that influence startup success.
